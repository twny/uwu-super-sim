1. **Install Rust and Create a Bevy Project**: Follow the steps mentioned
   in my previous response to set up the development environment.
1. **Project Structure**: Organize your project into separate modules for different game components, such as player, enemies, items, UI, races, skills, classes, and alignment.
1. **Implement Basic Game Loop**: Start by implementing a basic game loop in Bevy, including rendering a simple scene, handling input, and updating game state.
1. **Character Creation**: Implement character creation, allowing players to choose a race, class, and initial skills. Also, implement the "bouba" or "kiki" appearance choice.
1. **Game Mechanics**: Implement core gameplay mechanics like skill gain based on in-game actions, crafting, animal taming, and stealing. Make sure to provide rapid skill gain so characters can quickly become useful in their chosen paths.
1. **Open World**: Create a procedurally generated open world that includes various regions and biomes. Populate the world with a diverse range of creatures, enemies, and NPCs based on the list you provided.
1. **PvP and Player Collaboration**: Implement PvP combat and mechanics to encourage player collaboration, such as forming groups or societies for mutual protection.
1. **Networking**: Implement multiplayer functionality using a suitable networking library or solution for Rust. Bevy has some experimental networking features, but you may need to choose a more mature networking library for better support.
1. **Art Style**: Use a surreal, Picasso-inspired art style for the game's visuals. You can start with basic shapes and colors and refine the art as the project progresses.
